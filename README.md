# Hello and Welcome 👋🏽


Hi my name is Martha! Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I showcase the projects I've worked on, both completed and in progress, and provide a glimpse into my experience as a developer. Here, you can also find the best ways to get in touch with me and keep up to date with what I'm currently working on.

I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. That's why you'll see some unfinished projects in my portfolio - I'm constantly working on improving them and making them the best they can be.

In addition to showcasing my work, this portfolio is also a reflection of my journey as a developer. From my early projects to my latest endeavors, you'll see how my skills have grown and evolved over time.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about me as a developer. If you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out!
